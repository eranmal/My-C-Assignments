# Hybrid Data Structures - Pokédex Management System

## Overview
A comprehensive management system that combines multiple data structures to manage Pokémon trainers and their respective collections. This project is a rigorous exercise in pointers and hybrid structure interaction.

## Key Features
* **Doubly Circular Linked List:** Manages the high-level list of owners, allowing for seamless circular navigation.
* **Binary Search Tree (BST):** Each owner stores their Pokémon in a BST, optimized for ID-based searching and insertion.
* **Generic Traversals:** Uses **Function Pointers** to implement generic BFS and DFS (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order) traversals.
* **Deep Copy & Merging:** Logic to merge two BSTs while checking for duplicates and handling manual memory replication.
* **Battle & Evolution Logic:** Dynamic modification of BST nodes and statistical comparison formulas.

## Skills Demonstrated
* Integration of Multiple Data Structures (BST + Linked List)
* Function Pointers for Generic Operations
* Complex Pointer Logic and Memory Safety
