# C Programming & Algorithms Portfolio

## **Overview**
Welcome to my C programming portfolio. This repository contains a comprehensive collection of projects developed during my second year as a Computer Science student at **Bar-Ilan University**. These assignments demonstrate a progression from fundamental bitwise manipulation to advanced data structures, recursive problem-solving, and rigorous manual memory management.

## **Projects Directory**

### **1. Bitwise Manipulation & Logic**
* **Focus**: Direct memory manipulation and binary logic.
* **Key Logic**: Implements functions to query, set, and toggle specific bits within integers.
* **Features**: Includes parity checking (Even/Odd) and numeric base conversions from Octal to Hexadecimal.

### **2. Algorithmic Number Theory**
* **Focus**: Iterative problem solving and mathematical properties.
* **Key Logic**: Algorithms to identify **Happy Numbers**, **Balanced Numbers**, and the **Circle of Joy** (prime palindromes).
* **Features**: Procedural generation of a customizable "Happy Face" using nested loops and symbols.

### **3. Multi-Dimensional Data Analytics**
* **Focus**: Managing complex datasets using 3D arrays.
* **Key Logic**: Utilization of a 3D "Sales Cube" to track automotive performance across dimensions of time, brands, and vehicle types.
* **Features**: Automated calculation of **Delta Metrics** and overall performance insights for high-volume data.

### **4. Advanced Recursion & Backtracking**
* **Focus**: Solving non-linear problems through recursive state management.
* **Key Logic**: Complex backtracking solvers for the **N-Queens Battle** and a dynamic **Crossword Generator**.
* **Features**: Recursive implementations of a **Human Pyramid** weight distribution, **Parenthesis Validation**, and a **Robot Path** finder.

### **5. Dynamic Memory Management System**
* **Focus**: Heap management and pointer-to-pointer structures.
* **Key Logic**: A music streaming simulation (Spotify) handling nested structures of Songs, Playlists, and a main database.
* **Features**: Custom implementation of dynamic string input and manual memory cleanup for deeply nested objects to prevent leaks.

### **6. Hybrid Data Structures (Pokédex System)**
* **Focus**: Integration of trees and circular linked lists for scalable systems.
* **Key Logic**: A multi-user system where Owners are managed via a **Doubly Circular Linked List** and individual collections via **Binary Search Trees (BST)**.
* **Features**: Generic traversals (BFS/DFS) using **Function Pointers**, collection merging algorithms, and alphabetical sorting.

## **Technical Skills Demonstrated**
* **Low-Level Programming**: Bit-masking, bit-shifting, and pointer arithmetic.
* **Memory Management**: Proficient use of `malloc`, `realloc`, and `free` to manage dynamic data in complex systems.
* **Data Structures**: Implementation and manipulation of BSTs, Doubly Circular Linked Lists, and 3D Arrays.
* **Algorithms**: Backtracking, Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and recursive modeling.

## **How to Use**
Each project is contained within its own directory. To compile and run a specific assignment (e.g., Assignment 6):
```bash
gcc ex6.c -o assignment6
./assignment6
