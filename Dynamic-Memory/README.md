# Dynamic Memory Management - Music Streaming Simulator

## Overview
A simulation of a music streaming platform (Spotify) that focuses on the complex management of nested dynamic data structures and manual memory cleanup.

## Key Features
* **Nested Dynamic Structures:** Manages a hierarchy of `Spotify -> Playlist -> Song` using pointers-to-pointers.
* **Manual Memory Management:** Extensive use of `malloc`, `realloc`, and `free` to handle dynamic growth and deletion of objects.
* **Dynamic Array Resizing:** Implements logic to expand and shrink arrays of playlists and songs as users modify the collection.
* **Sorting Algorithms:** Includes multiple sorting modes (Year, Streams, Alphabetical) for songs within a playlist.

## Skills Demonstrated
* Advanced Pointer Manipulation
* Dynamic Memory Allocation & Deallocation (Manual Heap Management)
* Struct-based Object Modeling
