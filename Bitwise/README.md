# Bitwise Manipulation & Data Representation

## Overview
This project implements a suite of low-level tools for bitwise operations and data representation in C. It focuses on the direct manipulation of memory and binary data, which is essential for understanding systems programming.

## Key Features
* **Bit Querying & Modification:** Functions to extract, set, and toggle bits at specific positions using bitwise shifting and masking.
* **Parity Checking:** Algorithmic determination of even or odd numbers using binary logic.
* **Cross-Base Summation:** A utility to sum octal inputs and represent the result in hexadecimal format.
* **Specific Bit Extraction:** Isolating multiple specific bits (e.g., 3rd, 5th, 7th, 11th) from a summed result.

## Skills Demonstrated
* Binary Arithmetic and Logic
* Bit-masking and Bit-shifting operations
* Input formatting for Octal/Hexadecimal in C
