# Advanced Recursion & Backtracking Solvers

## Overview
This project showcases high-level recursive problem-solving techniques, ranging from simple mathematical recursion to complex backtracking algorithms.

## Key Features
* **N-Queens Battle:** A backtracking solver that finds valid queen placements on a board with additional "colored group" constraints.
* **Crossword Generator:** A complex backtracking algorithm that fits words into a grid based on slot direction and overlapping constraints.
* **The Human Pyramid:** A recursive weight distribution calculator that determines the pressure on each member of a cheerleader pyramid.
* **Parenthesis Validator:** A recursive parser that validates balanced brackets/braces without using an explicit stack structure.
* **Robot Path Finder:** Calculates the total number of unique paths in a grid using recursive step logic.

## Skills Demonstrated
* Backtracking and Search Algorithms
* Recursive State Management
* Dynamic Grid Manipulation
