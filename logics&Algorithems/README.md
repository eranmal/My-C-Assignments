# Numerical Logic & Algorithmic Patterns

## Overview
A collection of diverse algorithmic solvers focused on number theory, mathematical properties, and procedural pattern printing.

## Key Features
* **Happy Numbers:** An iterative solver to identify numbers that reach 1 when replaced by the sum of the squares of their digits.
* **Balanced Numbers:** Logic to determine if the sums of digits on either side of a number's center are equal.
* **Circle of Joy (Prime Palindromes):** Determines if a number and its reverse are both prime.
* **Generous (Abundant) Numbers:** Checks if the sum of a number's proper divisors exceeds the number itself.
* **Procedural UI Printing:** Dynamically generates a "Happy Face" based on user-defined dimensions and symbols.

## Skills Demonstrated
* Complex Loop Structures and Nested Logic
* Number Theory Algorithms
* Procedural ASCII Art Generation
